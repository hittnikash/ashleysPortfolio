<b>Lighthouse Audits</b> 
<p>I ran Lighthouse Audits to see where I could improve, performance, accessibility, Best Practices & Search Engine Optimization.
My first Audit showed me that I needed to improve on my semantics, and to make sure I was following good practices.</p>

<p>My second Audit was looking better, with Best practices but- still I went through to see how I could improve upon performance and accessibility.
I ended up shrinking my images dramatically and changed them from pngs to jpgs and then sent them through an image optimizer to save on file size.</p>

<p>My third audit showed little improvement. But still I kept looking through the report to see where I could improve. </p>

<p>My fourth audit I started to think that the performance score may also have something to do with network connection.</p>

<p>As these scores were inconsistent each time I generated a new report. I decided to focus on accessibility, Best practices and SEO.  
Below is the last audit done before site submission.</p>
